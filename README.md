Simple Eight Ball React.js Web Application. 
I made a very very simple javascript version of an eightball console app, and decided to make it into a react app so it can be more interactive :)

![screenshot of my app](Screen%20Shot%202023-04-25%20at%201.55.16%20pm.png/img.png)

How to use: 
Download repo & cd to eightball dir. Then, in the console do 'npm start' to run the react app.

Rules:
1. Enter your question through the input box and click 'Go!'
2. Once you are happy with your question click the 'Generate Answer' button to generate your answer
3. Once done, click 'Reset' to go back and do another question
4. Enjoy your random eightball answer (its wisdom is final)

Just for fun and practise!
